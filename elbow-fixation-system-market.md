<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Elbow Fixation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Fixation</li><li>Internal Fixation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The elbow fixation system market comprises two main types: external fixation and internal fixation. External fixation involves the application of a frame outside the body that stabilizes the bone through pins or clamps, offering the benefit of adjustable tension and minimal invasiveness. In contrast, internal fixation utilizes implants, such as screws or plates, surgically inserted inside the body to achieve stable alignment of fractured bones. Both methods aim to promote healing and restore elbow functionality while addressing specific patient needs.</p></p>
